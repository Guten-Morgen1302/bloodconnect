Blood Donor Connect / Facebook Groups ‚Üí Social-based, but unreliable in emergencies and prone to spam.

Gaps / Unmet Needs
No real-time blood availability updates from local blood banks.

Lack of push notifications to alert nearby matching donors instantly.

Outdated, slow UIs that frustrate users in emergencies.

No AI-based donor matching that considers urgency, proximity, and blood type.

Target Audience & Pain Points
Families in emergencies ‚Üí Need immediate donor connection without calling 50 numbers.
